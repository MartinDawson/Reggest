        <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
        <p>
          CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
          websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
          The law&apos;s reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company
          in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting
          Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous
          privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and
          those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at:

        <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>

        <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
        <p>
          When it comes to the collection of personal information from children
          under the age of 13 years old, the Children&apos;s Online Privacy Protection
          Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States&apos;
          consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what
          operators of websites and online services must do to protect children&apos;s
          privacy and safety online.

          We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old.

        <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
        <p>
          The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy
          law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
          role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
          the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is
          critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.

          In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the
          following responsive action, should a data breach occur:

          We will notify you via email within 7 business days. We will also
          notify users via an in-site notification on the home page within 7 business days.

          We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals
          have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors
          and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only
          that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that
          individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate
          and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
