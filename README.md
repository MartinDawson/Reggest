### The problem
There are a lot of fitness plans in the world that overwhelm beginners

### The solution
Implement a simplistic QandA functionality type app that suggests the best fitness plans to meet the users goals

### Key aspects
- Must provide a fitness plan that meets the users needs
- Must be as simple as possible for the user
- The faster the user gets to their chosen fitness plan in as little questions as possible the better
- Must only provide fitness plans that are being used by many people and/or have proven results

### Current Target Audience
- Beginners who are starting fitness in gyms, specifically users from r/fitness and r/xxfitness

### Business Model
- Free app

### Competitors
- http://www.rohitnair.net/pp/: 
  - End results are a long wall of text for some chosen features
  - Doesn't list many results for chosen fitness programs
  - Unnecessary choices such as Police/Military Training which noone cares about
  - Not specific enough to users goals, e.g. days per week training
- https://www.bodbot.com/
  - Doesn't list specific fitness plans such as 'Strong Curves', 'Nsuns' etc but instead gives specific exercices
  - Not recommended by r/xxfitness or r/fitness to do this but instead to use pre-made tested plans
- http://www.strongur.io/
  - Same problems as bodbot
